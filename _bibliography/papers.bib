  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Driven by generative AI and the Internet, there is an increasing availability of a wide variety of images, leading to the significant and popular task of cross-domain image retrieval. To reduce annotation costs and increase performance, this paper focuses on an untouched but challenging problem, i.e., cross-domain image retrieval with partial labels (PCIR). Specifically, PCIR faces great challenges due to the ambiguous supervision signal and the domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called disambiguated domain alignment (DiDA) for cross-domain retrieval with partial labels. In detail, DiDA elaborates a novel prototype-score unitization learning mechanism (PSUL) to extract common discriminative representations by simultaneously disambiguating the partial labels and narrowing the domain gap. Additionally, DiDA proposes a prototype-based domain alignment mechanism (PBDA) to further bridge the inherent cross-domain discrepancy. Attributed to PSUL and PBDA, our DiDA effectively excavates domain-invariant discrimination for cross-domain image retrieval. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiDA through comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  title={Diffilter: Defending against adversarial perturbations with diffusion filter},
  author={Chen, Yong and Li, Xuedong and Wang#, Xu and Hu, Peng and Peng, Dezhong},
  abstract={The inherent vulnerability of deep learning to adversarial examples poses a significant security challenge. Although existing defense methods have partially mitigated the harm caused by adversarial attacks, they are still unable to meet practical needs due to their high cost, high latency, and poor defense performance. In this paper, we propose an advanced plug-and-play adversarial purification model called DifFilter. Specifically, we use the superior generative properties of diffusion models to denoise adversarial perturbations and recover clean images. To make Gaussian noise disrupt adversarial perturbations while preserving the real semantic information in the input image, we extend forward diffusion to an infinite number of noise scales so that the distribution of perturbation data evolves with increasing noise according to stochastic differential equations. In the inverse denoising process, we develop a score-based model learning method to restore the input prior distribution to the data distribution of the original clean sample, resulting in stronger purification effects. Additionally, we propose an efficient sampling method to accelerate the computation speed of inverse process, greatly reducing the time cost of purification. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the defense generalization performance of DifFilter. The results demonstrate that our method not only surpasses existing defense methods in defense robustness under strong adaptive and black-box attacks but also achieves higher certificate accuracy than the baseline. Furthermore, DifFilter can be combined with adversarial training to further improve defense robustness.},

  abstract={Visual grounding aims at localizing objects in images using natural language expressions. This task can be challenging when there are significant differences between the distributions of the training and testing sets. Existing methods tend to excessively focus on the training sets, which could lead to overfitting, especially in small-sample scenarios. To address this issue, in this letter, we present a novel meta-learning-based training framework called MetaVG, for visual grounding. Our approach leverages bi-level optimization to adapt quickly to the target task, thereby alleviating the overfitting issue. To train MetaVG effectively, we propose a novel training mechanism called Random Uncorrelated Meta-training (RUM). This mechanism proposes to randomly load uncorrelated batches as support and query sets respectively in the data separation process, then utilize bi-level optimization to directly train the model on visual grounding datasets. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used datasets, as well as in small-sample scenarios, validate the efficacy of MetaVG.}

  abstract={Cross-modal hashing (CMH) has gained much attention due to its effectiveness and efficiency in facilitating efficient retrieval between different modalities. Whereas, most existing methods unconsciously ignore the hierarchical structural information of the data, and often learn a single-layer hash function to directly transform cross-modal data into common low-dimensional hash codes in one step. This sudden drop of dimension and the huge semantic gap can cause the discriminative information loss. To this end, we adopt a coarse-to-fine progressive mechanism and propose a novel Hierarchical Consensus Cross-Modal Hashing (HCCH) . Specifically, to mitigate the loss of important discriminative information, we propose a coarse-to-fine hierarchical hashing scheme that utilizes a two-layer hash function to refine the beneficial discriminative information gradually. And then, the ℓ2,1 -norm is imposed on the layer-wise hash function to alleviate the effects of redundant and corrupted features. Finally, we present consensus learning to effectively encode data into a consensus space in such a progressive way, thereby reducing the semantic gap progressively. Through extensive contrast experiments with some advanced CMH methods, the effectiveness and efficiency of our HCCH method are demonstrated on four benchmark datasets.}

  abstract={This paper presents a novel method for supervised multi-view representation learning, which projects multiple views into a latent common space while preserving the discrimination and intrinsic structure of each view. Specifically, an apriori discriminant similarity graph is first constructed based on labels and pairwise relationships of multi-view inputs. Then, view-specific networks progressively map inputs to common representations whose affinity approximates the constructed graph. To achieve graph consistency, discrimination, and cross-view invariance, the similarity graph is enforced to meet the following constraints: 1) pairwise relationship should be consistent between the input space and common space for each view; 2) within-class similarity is larger than any between-class similarity for each view; 3) the inter-view samples from the same (or different) classes are mutually similar (or dissimilar). Consequently, the intrinsic structure and discrimination are preserved in the latent common space using an apriori approximation schema. Moreover, we present a sampling strategy to approach a sub-graph sampled from the whole similarity structure instead of approximating the graph of the whole dataset explicitly, thus benefiting lower space complexity and the capability of handling large-scale multi-view datasets. Extensive experiments show the promising performance of our method on five datasets by comparing it with 18 state-of-the-art methods.}
