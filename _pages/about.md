Welcome to my homepage! I am Dr. Xu Wang (王旭). I am currently an Associate Researcher at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University. I received the B.E. degree and Ph.D. degree from Sichuan University in 2015 and 2021, respectively. I was a Joint Ph.D at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), University of Adelaide, funded by the China Scholarship Council from 2019 to 2021. I am also a Visiting Research Scientist at the Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore.
